# HRD

This project is a heart rate detection software based on python. Our user client was developped by PySimpleGui. We used an esp32 camera to send mqtt message to AWS server, then, our client and backend part will get the message. The backend part will calculate the heart rate, plot the heart rate and publish the plot to AWS server. The client will get the raw image from the camera and the heart rate image from backend. Our demo video is here: [(English version)](), or [(Chinese version)]().
